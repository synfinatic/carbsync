### CarbSync

While there are some good tools already on the market by companies like
[MotionPro](http://www.motionpro.com/motorcycle/partno/08-0411/) or 
[Morgan Carbtune](http://www.carbtune.com/), they tend to be complicated,
may use fluids which are toxic or spill, and require a complex calibration
sequence for best results.

CarbSync is a simple tool for syncing carberators or throttle bodies which uses
digital vacuum gauges to measure the vacuum on 2 to 4 cylinders.  By using 
solid-state vacuum gauges which require no calibration and have no fluid to leak,
CarbSync is both accurate and easy to use.

### Technical Specs
 * CarbSync has a useful vacuum measurement range of 0 to -7.25 PSI (-50 kPA)
     allowing it to be used with almost any vehicle
 * CarbSync has a LCD for displaying results
 * CarbSync supports 2, 3 or 4 cylinder engines
 * Powered by AA batteries
