### CarbSync

While there are some good tools already on the market by companies like
[MotionPro](http://www.motionpro.com/motorcycle/partno/08-0411/), they tend
to be complicated to use and require a complex calibration sequence for
best results.

CarbSync is a simple tool for syncing carberators or throttle bodies which uses
digital vacuum gauges to measure the vacuum on 2 to 4 cylinders.  By using 
solid-state vacuum gauges, CarbSync is both accurate and easy to use.
